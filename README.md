Inter-Process Communication Implementation

This project showcases the implementation of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) using Pipes and Sockets in C++. IPC serves as a crucial mechanism for processes to exchange data and synchronize actions. The project demonstrates:

    Pipes (IPC within the same system): Unidirectional communication between processes using pipe() function for data exchange.
    Sockets (IPC across different systems): Bidirectional communication between processes across distinct systems utilizing server-client architecture.

Key Features:

    Detailed code explanations for both Pipes and Sockets implementation.
    Parent-child relationship demonstration for Pipes.
    Server-client model explanation for Socket implementation.

Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates IPC methodologies, emphasizing the exchange of data within the same system (Pipes) and across different systems (Sockets). It highlights the simplicity of Pipes and the versatility of Sockets in handling IPC.
